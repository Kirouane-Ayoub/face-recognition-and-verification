Facial Recognition is the process of identifying a person based on their face. It involves comparing a live capture or digital image of a face to a database of stored images and matches it with a previously identified person.

Facial Verification, on the other hand, is the process of confirming a user's claimed identity by comparing a live capture or digital image of their face to a stored reference image. It is typically used as a means of authentication, to ensure that the person claiming to be a specific individual is indeed who they claim to be.
